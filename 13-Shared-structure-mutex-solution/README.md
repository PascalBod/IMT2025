# Shared structure and mutex exercise solution

## How the project was created

See solution to exercise 12.

## Note

As you saw in the mutex API, the take operation can be protected by a timeout, set to 300 ms in our source code (`MUTEX_WAIT_PERIOD_MS`). Try to decrease this value, and check what happens.
